NOTE: make sure the values you use exist on your platform�, it will be port=0 and pin=1,
PC14 would be port=2 and pin=14 etc.

main(): This is RIOT! (Version: buildtest)
GPIO peripheral driver test

In this test, pins are specified by integer port and pin numbers.
So if your platform has a pin PA01, it will be port=0 and pin=1,
PC14 would be port=2 and pin=14 etc.

NOTE: make sure the values you use exist on your platform! The
      behavior for not existing ports/pins is not defined!
