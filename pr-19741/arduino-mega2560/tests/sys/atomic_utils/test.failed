Test Application for sys/atomic_utils
=====================================

Use the shell commands "tearing_test" and "lost_update_test" to
test the various <flavor>_fetch_<op>_u<width> functions for lost
updates and store tearing. The "list" shell commands lists
functions to test. See below which function families should
pass which tests.

The atomic_fetch_<op>_u<width> family must pass all tests.

The semi_atomic_fetch_<op>_u<width> family must pass the tearing
test, but may fail the lost update test.

The volatile_fetch_<op>_u<width> family should fail the lost update
tests for all platforms. On most platforms they should fail the
tearing tests for widths greater than the word size. (One exception
is the Cortex-M7 family, which can by using instruction fusion issue
two 32 bit writes in a single CPU cycle.). The volatile family is
provided to verify that the test actually can detect issues. Any
failure here is not an indication of an issue, but indicates the.
test is working as expected.
