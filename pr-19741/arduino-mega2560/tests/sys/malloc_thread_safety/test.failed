Test Application for multithreaded use of malloc()
==================================================

This test will run duelling threads allocating and freeing memory.
The running thread is interrupted every millisecond and the other
threads gets scheduled. Eventually, this should yield to memory
corruption unless proper guards are in place preventing them. After
ca. two seconds without crash, the test is considered as passing.

WARNING: Use of mallinfo() disabled.
