Test application for gnrc_tx_sync
=================================

This application sends a single UDP datagram over a virtual Ethernet
or 802.15.4 device. (Set TEST_6LO to 1 for 802.15.4 and to 0 for
Ethernet.) The simulated network devices blocks for 100ms - more than
enough time for sock_upd_send() to return if no synchronization is done.
If an 802.15.4 device is simulated, the test datagram will be transmitted
in two fragments. In that case sock_udp_send() must only return after both
fragments are out. In the Ethernet case, only a single frame is send.

IEEE 802.15.4 mode (TEST_6LO=1, TEST_FRAG_SFR=1), sending 2 6LoWPAN fragmentstransmissions expected = 2, transmissions completed = 2
sent 94 out of 94 bytes
